== Playbooks to configure OpenShift 4.x cluster
Couple of ansible roles to configure serveral components for a fresh install of
an openshift cluster.

IMPORTANT: None of these role are written to be used blindly. They are provided
as a POC/minimum viable option to get you kickstarted without having to put a
ton of effort to figure out exactly what all needs to be done.

A lot of assumptions are made.
So please walk through the roles first, before attempting to run them.

=== Setting up your environment to run the playbooks

==== RHEL7

Assuming that you are running as root. Adjust accordingly

----
yum install ansible
yum install python27-python-pip
pip install -U setuptools
pip install --user openshift kubernetes
----

=== Runing the indivdual roles
You can run individual roles by runnning ansible playbook against the
roles/<role-name>/apply/main.yaml playbook in each of the individual roles.

----
ansible-playbook roles/<role-name>/apply/main.yaml
----

Below are the list of ansible roles that are available. Do checkout the
individual role's documenation for more information on what they do.
