== Scheduler Config

=== Tasks performed in this role

The below key tasks are performed

* Label infra nodes with the following labels
** node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
** workload=infra
* Move default ingress router to the infra nodes
* Create a new MachineConfigPool (MCP) for infra nodes.
** This will allow us to remove the worker node-role from the infra nodes.
** the infra MCP inherits form the worker nodes.
** This MCP is required to make sure that when the cluster is upgraded the
   infra nodes are also upgraded.

=== TODO
* Need to update this readme.
* We are creating a new MCP. We should possibly wait for all the machine
  configs to be rendered and pushed out before we move on to other roles.
